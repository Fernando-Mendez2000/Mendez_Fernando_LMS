Library Management System

Introduction

This Java program represents an application for managing a library's collection of books. Users can list all existing books, add new books to the collection, and remove books. 
The book data is stored in a text file. The program aims to offer a simplified library management experience by providing interactive functionality to add, remove, and display 
books while persisting book information in a text file for data retention. The program uses the 'Library' and 'Book' classes to manage book-related operations. The 'Library' class 
handles book storage and management, while the 'Book' class defines the structure of an individual book.
